  - `useGameLogic.ts` - Core game logic (343 lines)
  - `useGameState.ts` - State management
  - `useComputerAI.ts` - AI logic
  - `useFeedbackCorrection.ts` - Feedback correction system
- **Clean component architecture** with proper props interfaces and separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive internationalization** support (EN/ZH/JA) with react-i18next
- **Advanced game logic** including:
  - Draw conditions when both players succeed in same round
  - 3-hint system for player assistance
  - Feedback correction system for inconsistent responses
  - Computer AI with complaint system for invalid feedback
- **Professional commit message policy** and comprehensive documentation

### **Testing Infrastructure:**

  - Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) - 20+ component and hook tests
  - Integration tests (`tests/integration/`) - Complete game flows
  - End-to-end tests (`tests/e2e/`) - Browser automation with Playwright
- **Clean linting**: ESLint passes with no issues
- **Good test organization** with proper setup and utilities

### **Development Experience:**
- **Modern tooling**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Comprehensive package.json** with proper scripts
- **Professional documentation** in README.md with deployment info
- **AI-generated codebase** showcase demonstrating modern development practices

## ‚ùå **Issues & Areas Needing Improvement**

### 1. **E2E Testing Infrastructure** (üö® Critical Issue)

**Problem:** All 15 E2E tests failing due to connection errors:
```
page.goto: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED at http://localhost:5173/guess_number/
```

**Root Cause:** E2E tests expect development server to be running but there's no automated setup

**Impact:** 
- No browser automation testing coverage
- CI/CD pipeline would fail
- Manual testing required for UI regressions

**Solution Required:**
- Set up test infrastructure to automatically start dev server
- Add proper E2E test configuration
- Consider adding Playwright CI setup

### 2. **Development Workflow Issues**

**Missing Infrastructure:**
- ‚ùå No pre-commit hooks setup (despite having comprehensive linting)
- ‚ùå No continuous integration configuration (.github/workflows/)
- ‚ùå No automated deployment verification
- ‚ùå No development server automation for E2E tests

**Developer Experience Gaps:**
- Limited debugging tools for complex game states
- No hot reload configuration documentation
- Missing development environment setup guide

### 3. **Performance & UX Enhancements**

**Performance Optimization Opportunities:**
- Bundle size not optimized (no code splitting implemented)
- No lazy loading for non-critical components
- Missing service worker for offline functionality
- No performance monitoring or metrics

**User Experience Limitations:**
- ‚ùå No loading states during computer AI "thinking" periods
- ‚ùå No smooth animations or transitions
- ‚ùå Limited accessibility features (missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- ‚ùå No dark mode despite modern UI expectations
- Basic error messaging without user-friendly explanations

### 4. **Game Features & Logic**

**Missing Advanced Features:**
- **Difficulty levels**: Only supports 4-digit mode (could add 3/5/6 digit modes)
- **Game statistics**: Basic records exist but no analytics dashboard
- **Multiplayer support**: No real-time multiplayer or tournaments
- **Achievement system**: No gamification elements
- **Game replay**: Cannot review past games in detail
- **Export/import**: No way to backup/restore game records
- **Time-based challenges**: No speed mode or time limits

**AI Improvements Needed:**
- Computer AI uses basic random selection from valid candidates
- Could implement more sophisticated strategies (minimax, entropy-based selection)
- No adaptive difficulty based on player performance
- Missing AI personality modes (aggressive, defensive, analytical)

### 5. **Technical Debt**

**Code Organization Issues:**
- `gameUtils.ts` is quite large (260 lines) and handles multiple concerns
- Mixed legacy and modern patterns in history handling
- Some component props interfaces could be more granular
- Utility functions could be better organized into modules

**Configuration Management:**
- Hard-coded game configuration values in `GAME_CONFIG`
- No environment-specific configurations
- Limited runtime customization options
- No feature flags system

**Type Safety:**
- Some `any` types could be more specific
- Missing error boundary implementations
- Could benefit from stricter TypeScript configuration

### 6. **Documentation & Developer Experience**

**Missing Documentation:**
- ‚ùå API documentation for custom hooks and utilities
- ‚ùå Contributing guidelines for new developers
- ‚ùå Performance benchmarking documentation
- ‚ùå Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- ‚ùå Deployment troubleshooting guide

**Development Tooling:**
- No Storybook or component documentation
- Missing visual regression testing
- No automated accessibility testing
- Limited debugging tools for game state
